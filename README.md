Machine learning is evloving day by day and is solving many real life problems that are life changing. One such application is violence detection which uses machine learning model trained with lots of videos including violence to detect violence in live stream and/or in pre-recorded video. Violence detection includes detection of physical beating, stabbing, robbery, firing of gun, riot, hijack, terrorist attack, etc. 

# Methodology  <img src="https://github.com/LalithNarayanan/real-life-violence-detection/blob/main/Icons/solution.png" width="60" height="60">  

Violence detection using transfer learning involves using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, and re-purposing it for the task of violence detection. The methodology involves fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a smaller dataset of violent and non-violent videos, and then testing the model on new, unseen videos. Transfer learning can significantly reduce the time and resources required for model training, as it leverages the pre-existing knowledge of the pre-trained CNN.


# Dataset  <img src="https://github.com/LalithNarayanan/real-life-violence-detection/blob/main/Icons/Dataset.jpeg" width="60" height="60"> 

The dataset used in this project is the ‘Real Life Violence Situations Dataset’  from the Kaggle Repository published by Mohamed Elesawy.
The dataset contains 1000 Violence and 1000 non-violence videos collected from youtube videos, which includes many real street fights situations in several environments and conditions.

✅ Used model using intel oneAPI
